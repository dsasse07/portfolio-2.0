## Overview
This project was created using the NextJS Framework and React with Typescript. The Github GraphQL API is used to fetch tagged portfolio projects and commit activity. Additionally, the markdown from project READMEs is parsed in to create project info pages. For my blog articles, the Dev.to REST API is used to fetch article markdown which is similarly parsed.
